## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up the Environment

1. **Create a new Python virtual environment** named `lesa_venv` using the `.yml` file by running the following command in your CLI:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f medical_lesa/lesa_venv.yml
    ```

2. **Activate the environment and create a Jupyter kernel** by running the following commands in the CLI:
    ```bash
    conda activate lesa_venv
    pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name lesa_venv --display-name "lesa_venv"
    ```

3. **Replace the `transformers/camembert` folder** with our version present in this repo by running the following command in your CLI:
    ```bash
    scp -r medical_lesa/camembert ~/.conda/envs/lesa_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models
    ```

4. **Replace the `transformers/__init__.py` file** with our version present in this repo:
    ```bash
    scp -r medical_lesa/transformers__init__.py ~/.conda/envs/lesa_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/__init__.py
    ```

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Data Processing

Before running the developed models or executing the `train.ipynb` notebook, users must first preprocess the medical data.

1. Begin by creating a folder named `sadcsip`. Inside this folder, place the two private files:
   - `NLP_data/2020.06.03_CHUSJ_Data_PatientID.csv`
   - `NLP_data/Labelling Le - 0 to 100.csv`

   These files contain the medical notes along with their corresponding annotations.

2. Next, open and run all cells in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. While the notebook is lengthy, it is fully commented and should be easy to follow.

Once completed, the required datasets will be generated in the correct format within the `sadcsip` folder.

## üöÄ Training LESABert

Now everything is ready to run the training process. Follow the instructions in the `train.ipynb` notebook for detailed steps on training the LESABert model with the preprocessed data.
